## 3. SpikyPOVs

### Truths
- **Centralized admin interface** improves system management and reduces operational complexity
- **Team-based organization** with leadership roles enables natural workflow delegation
- **Skill-based agent profiling** enhances ticket routing and team capability management
- **Custom metadata fields** provide flexibility for different use cases without schema changes
- **Natural language interfaces** enhance admin productivity without sacrificing control
- **Function-based AI tools** provide safer and more predictable outcomes than free-form generation
- **Real-time AI feedback** with confirmation steps prevents costly mistakes
- **Contextual AI operations** (team-aware, skill-aware) improve accuracy and reduce errors

### Myths
- **"Complex admin interfaces reduce usability"** - Well-designed tabs and real-time updates actually improve efficiency
- **"Team hierarchies add unnecessary complexity"** - They enable natural delegation and access control
- **"Fixed ticket schemas are more maintainable"** - Custom metadata fields provide needed flexibility without chaos
- **"Skill tracking should be simple tags"** - Proper proficiency levels enable better resource allocation
- **"AI interfaces require complex setup"** - Well-designed function calling provides natural interaction
- **"AI operations are too risky for admin tasks"** - Proper confirmation flows ensure safety
- **"Natural language is too ambiguous for precise operations"** - Structured function calls provide clarity
- **"AI features require complete system rebuilds"** - They can be seamlessly integrated into existing workflows
